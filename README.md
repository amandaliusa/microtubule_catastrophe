# Microtubule Catastrophe
This repository is home to our website detailing the analysis of microtubule
catastrophe data for [BE/Bi103a 2020](https://bebi103a.github.io/) at Caltech. 
The website can be found [here](https://amandaliusa.github.io/microtubule_catastrophe).
The template for the website repository was provided by [Griffin Chure](https://github.com/gchure),
and the data used in our analysis came from [Garner et. al](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(11)01287-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867411012876%3Fshowall%3Dtrue). 

This repository also includes code for our analysis, which can be found in microtubule_catastrophe_pkg. 

Our team consists of [Amanda Li](https://github.com/amandaliusa), [Maggie Sui](https://github.com/msui012), and
